# Dynamic Output

It's sometimes useful for a script to determine its own output set.  For example, you have might have a model where every object in the model needs to be written to its own file.  In this case, the `textrude.add_output` method can be used in conjunction with the **--dynamicOuput** flag.

For example this script
```
{{
textrude.add_output this "dyn.txt" "This is a file generated by the script"
}}
```
when invoked with
```
textrude.exe --template script.sbn --dynamicOutput --verbose
```
will generate a file called *dyn.txt* containing the text *This is a file generated by the script*

See the example "08_dynamic_output" project for a more advanced demonstration.
