Model 0 is {{model.name}}
Model 1 is {{model1.name}}
Model 2 is {{model2[0].name}}

'model' is synonymous with 'model0'...

'{{model.name}}' shoud be the same as '{{model.name}}'

To write to another output, use the capture keyword...

{{-capture output1}}
You won't see this in the output window. 
Check the "output1" window instead
{{end}}


{{-capture output2}}
Capture scopes are temporary.
{{end}}

That's all!
